        <p>You are probably familiar with the idea that transitions may be needed between paragraphs or sections in a
            paper (see our handout on transitions). Sometimes they are also helpful within the body of a single
            paragraph. Within a paragraph, transitions are often single words or short phrases that help to establish
            relationships between ideas and to create a logical progression of those ideas in a paragraph. This is
            especially likely to be true within paragraphs that discuss multiple examples. Let’s take a look at a
            version of our piranha paragraph that uses transitions to orient the reader:

            Although most people consider piranhas to be quite dangerous, they are, except in two main situations,
            entirely harmless. Piranhas rarely feed on large animals; they eat smaller fish and aquatic plants. When
            confronted with humans, piranhas’ instinct is to flee, not attack. But there are two situations in which a
            piranha bite is likely. The first is when a frightened piranha is lifted out of the water—for example, if it
            has been caught in a fishing net. The second is when the water level in pools where piranhas are living
            falls too low. A large number of fish may be trapped in a single pool, and if they are hungry, they may
            attack anything that enters the water.
